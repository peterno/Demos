## SignalR_NuGet ##

Demo from Stockholm Xamarin User Group meeting 2015-05-20.

Shows how to use SignalR with two different servers. 

The first server acts as a chat server, i.e. resends all incoming messages. Also has the ability to start and stop a timer.

The second server is the server part from Demo 3 of https://github.com/bradygaster/ignite-2015-signalr. When a shape is moved the move data is shown in the app.
